# CBA Case Study - Group Project
## Credit card customer segmentation

Unlabelled data for credit card usage was provided and we tried to answer the following questions.

1) What are the interesting factors that can be observed from the data through graphs?
2) Analyse the data visually to understand on what basis, segmentations can be done
3) Determine the model that can be developed and try to develop the model, evaluate and provide a future scope.
